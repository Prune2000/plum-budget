**Plum Budget is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React/Redux, Node.js).**

**The goal is to build a secure and confidential budget app.** Too many budget apps will sell financial information to 3rd parties as well as track users to get better insights on their shopping habits. This app aims to give a free and confidential app to track your daily finances.

The goal is to make the app an open source project when the first version is ready.

If you want to try it, you'll need to create your own Database and connect it to Express. 

To launch the app:
yarn dev

Will listen to localhost:3000
